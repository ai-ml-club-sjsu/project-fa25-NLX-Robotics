  "project_name": "[NLX Robotics]",
  "purpose": "NLP to MCU Actuator Action",
  "short_description": "This project tackles the challenge of making robots easier to control by turning everyday language into safe, 
  executable actions. Using a large language model (LLM) as a planner, natural-language commands are converted into validated JSON plans that drive a lightweight robotic arm with vision and safety checks. 
  The target audience is students, researchers, and hobbyists interested in bridging AI and robotics without heavy programming overhead. Expected outcomes include a working demo video, open-source code, 
  and measurable success metrics that prove the system’s reliability—ultimately offering a portfolio-ready platform showcasing how AI can enable intuitive human-robot interaction.",
